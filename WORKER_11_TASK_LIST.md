# Worker 11 Task List

Maintained by EM-3

## Active Task
- None awaiting assignment

## Completed Tasks

### Task 2: Investigate TS2322 solver fallback behavior ✅
- [x] Search for solver code that returns `Any` or `Error` as fallback
- [x] Identify where `lower_type` and subtyping checks bail out
- [x] Document the current fallback strategy in solver/ directory
- [x] Find 3-5 concrete examples of missing TS2322 errors from conformance tests
- [x] Create a patch plan: change `Any` fallback to `Unknown` for stricter checking
- [x] Document potential side effects (may convert missing errors to extra errors)

**Output:** See WORKER_11_TASK_2_ANALYSIS.md

**Key Finding:** Codebase is already strict with ERROR handling. Missing TS2322 errors are caused by diagnostic suppression and solver bailouts, not Any fallback.

**Goal:** Understand why 310 TS2322 errors are missing and plan the fix ✅

**Target Branch:** rust

### Task 1: Analyze current Rust/WASM setup in the codebase ✅
- [x] Explore the `wasm/` directory structure
- [x] Document existing Rust dependencies and build configuration
- [x] Identify any existing Rust code (*.rs files)
- [x] Check for Cargo.toml or related Rust configuration
- [x] Document the current build process for WASM components
- [x] Create a summary report of findings

**Output:** See WORKER_11_TASK_1_ANALYSIS.md

**Target Branch:** rust
